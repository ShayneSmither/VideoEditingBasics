# Importing Footage

[Click here to go back.](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics)

When you first open up your editing program, you will likely get a screen looking similar to this:

![blank screen](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/blank-editor.JPG)

To add the footage you would like to edit, click on File>Import>Media

![menu](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/menu.JPG)

Navigate to the footage you want to edit, then select it and click OK.

I will be using free stock videos that I found on <https://videos.pexels.com/>

Your newly imported footage will appear in a box at the top left corner of the screen, like so:

![exampleimport](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/exampleimport.JPG)

To add footage to your timeline, click and drag your footage into the lower gray blank area. You may get a pop up window like this:

![popup](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/popup.JPG)

Go ahead and click Yes, then it should look something like this:

![screen2](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/screen2.JPG)

You've imported footage!
