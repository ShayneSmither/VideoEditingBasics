# Importing Footage

[Click here to go back.](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics)

When you first open up your editing program, you will likely get a screen looking similar to this:

![blank screen](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/blank-editor.JPG)

To add the footage you would like to edit, click on File>Import>Media

![menu](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/import/menu.JPG)

Navigate to the footage you want to edit, then select it and click ok.
I will be using free stock videos that I found on <https://videos.pexels.com/>
