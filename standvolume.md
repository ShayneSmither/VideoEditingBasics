# Soundtracks and Volume

Soundtracks are handled extremely similarly to video footage. In fact, the importing process is the same. Once you have a soundtrack, or any audio file, simply drag it onto the timeline editor, and you will end up with a screen that looks something like this:

![timeline](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/standvolume/timeline.JPG)

Notice that the audio is on its own track, and has unique controls on the left side.

![controls](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/standvolume/controls.JPG)

These controls are used to mix the audio to your liking. The Vol slider changes how loud the audio will be (this is helpful when there are multiple audio tracks in the same timeline.) The Pan slider changes which speaker will play louder (this will only matter if you are playing the video in stereo.)

If there is one particular part in the audio that you want to be louder or quieter, you can insert an audio envelope by selecting the audio track in the timeline, then clicking Insert>Audio Envelope>Volume

![audioenvelope](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/standvolume/audioenvelope.JPG)

This will insert a line on your audio track that you can manipulate dynamically to change volume throughout the timeline. To change the volume in a specific spot, right click the line on the spot you want to manipulate, and add a point.

Then do the same on either side of the original point. You should now be able to drag the middle point up or down in that spot without effecting the rest of the audio.
