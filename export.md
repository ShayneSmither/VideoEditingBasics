Once you have your video the way you want, you will want to render it into a single playable file. To render your video, go to File>Render As

![renderas](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/render/renderas.JPG)

A render settings window will pop up.

![rendersettings](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/render/rendersettings.JPG)

You will need to choose where you want the file to save on the section labeled "Folder:" as well as what you want to name the video in the "Name:" section. You'll also need to choose the quality of the video you are rendering. My favorite is Internet HD 1080p for the purpose of uploading videos on the web, or just in general. Keep in mind there is no point to render out a higher quality video than the footage you originally used. If you use 480p footage, it won't magically look better by rendering it at 1080p. once you have made your choices, click Render. A box will pop up detailing the progress of your render.

This process will vary in completion time due to the complexity of your editing as well as the power of the computer doing the rendering.

When that is done, you've rendered footage!
