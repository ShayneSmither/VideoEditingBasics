Sometimes you may want to put text over your footage. If that is the case, go to the Media Generators tab:

![mediagenerator](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/text/mediagenerator.JPG)

Then choose the Title and Text menu. I'll be using the default text but feel free to experiment if you'd like.

![default](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/text/default.JPG)

Click and drag the kind of text you want into a new channel in the timeline.

![newchannel](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/text/newchannel.JPG)

Notice that no text is showing up on the preview. This is because whatever channel is on top of the timeline is closest to the screen. Right now the footage will cover the text, so we need to move the text channel by clicking and dragging it to the top.

![topchannel](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/text/topchannel.JPG)

Now that we can see the text in the preview, change the text to your liking using the Video Media Generators box. You can also change the placement of the text by clicking and dragging it on the preview to wherever you desire it to be. You can also cut and crossfade the text just like regular footage.

You've created text!
