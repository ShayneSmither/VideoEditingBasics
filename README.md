# Video Editing Basics

## Author: Shayne Smither

### Description: This tutorial is meant to be an easy reference for people who want to make basic edits to their footage such as cuts and transitions, or add soundtracks and edit volume. I will be using Sony Vegas Pro 14 to provide examples and screenshots, but the concepts and tools in one video editing program should apply to any others. For example, virtually all video editors use timelines to display, manipulate, and order footage. The main difference will be the user interface.

### Target Audience: Anyone who is completely new to video editing and just wants to learn how to do simple edits.
