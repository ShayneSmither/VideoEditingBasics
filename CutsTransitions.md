# Cuts and Transitions

If your footage is too small in the timeline to comfortably work on, you can zoom in by scrolling up on the scroll wheel. 

To cut the footage, drag the selector to the frame that you want to cut, like so:

![selector](https://github.com/ShayneSmither/VideoEditingBasics/blob/master/images/cutandtransition/selector.JPG)

Then right click the black line on top of the footage, and select "split"

You can now either delete the footage you don't want by selecting it and hitting the delete key.

When you are working on a video with several bits of footage, it can look jarring if you don't add in some sort of transition. My personal favorite is the crossfade because it's very easy to implement as well as good looking in most cases. To crossfade different bits of footage together, drag the later footage on to the footage you want to transition from. I usually let the crossfade take one second, which means the footage on the timeline overlaps for the duration of one second, like in the picture below.

You can now cut footage and implement a crossfade transition!
